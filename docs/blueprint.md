# **App Name**: Water Blocks Visualizer

## Core Features:

- Input Block Heights: Accept an array of block heights as input.
- Calculate Water Units: Calculate the units of water stored between blocks for a given array of block heights, where `n` (block height) > -1.
- Visualize Blocks: Visually represent the blocks as an SVG or Table View. Prefer SVG.
- Visualize Water: Display the water trapped between blocks, using color to differentiate water from the blocks.
- Display Water Units: Display the calculated number of water units stored.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Blue (#3498DB) for water representation, evoking calmness and clarity.
- Background color: Light gray (#ECF0F1) for a clean and neutral backdrop, improving content visibility (desaturated primary).
- Accent color: Light Blue (#2980B9) slightly darker variation of the primary to differentiate interactive UI elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look suitable for displaying numeric values.
- Use simple, geometric icons for input fields and actions.
- Use a clear and structured layout to represent the block array and computed value.
- Subtle animations, such as a gentle wave effect within the water blocks.
